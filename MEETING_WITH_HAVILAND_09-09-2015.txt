Key points to discuss:

- Roles that will exist across entire application - Administrator is most pertinent to him...
- How SIMPLE we can make it for Administrators to post to app
- They will be able to post the following:
	-> Extracurricular Updates
	-> Community Service Updates
	-> Urgent Alerts
	-> even more??? (all other Roles are contained within Administrator)
- Process of logging in, security, users can only create an account with a specific token we generate and provide securely.

- Static data dump needed from Administration at start of school year - staff directory, all extracurriculars, official stream of lunch menus, what links they would like to see, what polls they would like to ask.
